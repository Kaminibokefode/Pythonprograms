    "Extending the calculator from the last question, lets assume (accurately so) that you get a raise about twice year (every six months). Keeping this in mind, prompt the user for a semi-annual raise percentage (which will apply every six months) For example, if you start at 100,000 and get a 5% raise every six months, your salary for the first six months would be 8,333.33/month(base \\\\$100,000), and 8,750/month (base \\\\$105,000) for the following six months, and so on… \n",

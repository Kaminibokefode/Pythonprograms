# Interest Rate Calculation_Python
Dream house
- calculates how long it would take you to save enough money to pay the down payment for your dream house. 
  You will ask the user for their annual salary, the percent of the salary they’d want to save, and the cost of their dream home.
  You should assume that the down payment is 25% of the total cost of the home. The time should be expressed in months. Hint: annual salary / 12 will give you the monthly salary.
  
  Get a raise
  - Extending the calculator from the last question, lets assume (accurately so) that you get a raise about twice year (every six months). Keeping this in mind, prompt the user for a semi-annual raise percentage (which will apply every six months) For example, if you start at 100,000 and get a 5% raise every six months, your salary for the first six months would be 8,333.33/month(base $100,000), and 8,750/month (base $105,000) for the following six months, and so on
  
  Build some savings
 - The previous questions focused on how long you would have to work to afford the downpayment. In this question, you’re going to answer the reverse - how much would I have to save to be able to afford the downpayment in X years.
We can iron out some details prior, to make this easier: The semi-annual raise will be 7% The investments have an annual return of 4% The downpayment for the house will be 25% The dream house costs $1m.
For this question, you should find the best rate of savings so that the $1m downpayment can be paid in 3 years (36 months), given the user’s salary
